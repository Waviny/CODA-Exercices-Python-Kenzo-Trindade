## 📋 About The Project

This repository hosts my work on **Python programming** as part of the **Coda** curriculum. This project focuses on mastering Python's syntax and its powerful ability to manipulate different types of data with ease and efficiency.

The main objective was to write clean, readable, and "Pythonic" code while solving logical problems and automating data-related tasks.

> **Specific Goal:** Mastering data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples) and implementing logic to process and transform information effectively.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts Mastered

Working with Python allows for rapid development while requiring a good understanding of its internal mechanics. This project demonstrates my understanding of:

* **🐍 Pythonic Logic:** Writing concise and readable code using list comprehensions and built-in functions.
* **📊 Data Structures:** Advanced manipulation of lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples to store and retrieve data.
* **📂 File I/O & Parsing:** Reading from and writing to files, and managing data persistence.
* **🛠️ Scripting Automation:** Creating reusable scripts to automate repetitive tasks and data processing.
